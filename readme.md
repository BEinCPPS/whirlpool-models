# Whirlpool models

# MSEE tool

Aiming at introducing CPS innovation to enhance quality control procedures in Zero Hours Quality (ZHQ) department located in Whirlpool Appliance Factory in Biandronno (ITALY), the mentioned business process models describe the AS IS and TO BE situation of Zero Hours Quality, and are meant to be used to provide a shared working document for the design and implementation of the CPS-ization intervention.

The models are made of two different schemas:

* GRAI GRID (.graigrid file) schema, which describes the overall business process of ZHQ, at the different levels (strategical to operational) and with the three main functions that build it; the GRID includes the main ZHQ decision centers and relevant objectives and performance indicators
*  Extended Activity Star (.eastar files) diagrams which detail the business processes of the different functions of ZHQ.

## Business modeler environment

Usage of the models assumes having the SLM tool box installed in your environment, which is available at svn://repo.nimbus-ware.com/MSEE/SP1/WP15/D15.5/tags/v2.3.2/binaries/win32/slmtoolbox_modeling_environement-2.3.2.zip

SLM Tool Box is an integrated modeling tool, based on system engineering ECO-GRAI methodology, dedicated to manufacturing services lifecycle management. Key features are, at different levels:
* Business Service Model (BSM) Level: graphical domain specific languages (MDSEA);
* Technology Independent Modeling (TIM) Level: Open standards (UML, BPMN 2.0) for IT modeling;
*  Modular architecture: open source license (Eclipse).

## Usage of the models (example for the AS IS models):
1. Create a new BSM project name such as “Whirlpool ZHQ AS IS”, by using from the main menu
2. Copy the GRAIGRID file in the subfolder “Grai Grids”
3. Copy the eastar diagrams in the subfolder “Processes”

# MODELIO and SysML
Modelio version 3.6.0 has been installed in POLIMI  with the following free modules:
* Modeler Module, enabling UML modeling.
* SysML Architect, enabling SysML modeling.

SysML (www.omg.org) is a language designed for modeling system architecture and functional specifications, and it is an extension of a subset of UML modeling language (www.uml.org) visual modeling standard widely adopted by software architects and developers.

## Usage of the models

The WHR ZHQ complete model is available in the directory XMI, saved in Modelio with xmi format.
